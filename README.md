# caloric - dessert ysws by hackclub

calorie planner was initially a [react webapp](https://github.com/arsoninstigator/calorieplan) that is perfect for meal planning or cooking health-conscious versions of general delicacies for people on a diet / people with diabetes or high blood pressure or other health conditions or those just counting their macros and monitoring their intake. i've now made it into an android kotlin app called "caloric". you can download the .apk file from the release section!
